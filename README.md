# AWS Client
AWS Client is an open source JavaFX GUI desktop application for Amazon EC2, providing monitoring and filtering controls over your EC2 server instances in different regions. It also allows you to easily interact with your instances via your SSH client. More functionality will be added soon so follow [my blog](http://gadelkareem.com/aws-client) and watch AWS Client code on GitHub.
